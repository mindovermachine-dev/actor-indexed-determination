# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for agents working in the `actor-indexed-determination` (principle) repository.

## What this repo is

The framework is a **claim graph**, not a set of documents. Files are a storage format; the graph is
the object. This is the **stable, actor-general layer** of the split: it holds the canonical claims
and terms that the software-projection repository pins remotely. Per the Stable Dependency Principle,
**this repository carries no reference to its dependents** — do not add references to the software
projection, its apparatus, or its applications anywhere under `core/`.

Read `core/README.md`, then, before changing any claim or converting any prose:

- `spec/claim-format.md` — the claim schema (format 1) and its validation rules.
- `spec/claim-format-2-addendum.md` — the additive extensions **in force**: `canonical_md` and
  `canonical_home`, which let a claim serve as an embed source; `retired_from`, which records the
  maturity a retired claim held; and the falsifier condition held at every live status. All
  format-1 claims remain valid unchanged, which is why none of it needed a format bump — format 2
  is reserved for the first change that cannot be additive (`DDD-dec-32`, `DDD-dec-33`).
- `spec/claim-format.md` §5 — **what the statuses mean and what they do not.** Read it before
  citing a status to anyone outside the programme: `established` is internally argued and
  unchallenged, not externally validated, and it is four claims, all `formal`.
- `core/graph/terms.yaml` — the canonical term registry. Every term a doc `establishes` has an entry
  here; edit canonical text **here**, never in the doc, and re-project.

## Working on canon

**The repo is ground truth, always.** Verify against the live repo before landing anything in
`core/`; never carry a claim's statement, status, or evidence on the confidence of prose, and where
evidence is executable, verify against a fresh run of the asset. Computations that back a reported
claim live in `core/assets/` and must reproduce — a claim whose computation fails demotes until fixed.

- **Canon authority lives in the claim files and the term registry.** For a converted document,
  `core/claims/*.yaml` and `core/graph/terms.yaml` govern; the prose is their exposition. Prose that
  contradicts its claim is a bug in the prose — flag it in the claim's `notes:`, do not silently
  harmonise.
- **The reading order is the dependency order.** Each doc's `ddd:contract` declares what it requires
  and establishes; every edge must point backward. A forward edge is an escaped seam.
- **Never present an identity holding as evidence for the framework.** State which is arithmetic and
  which is a modelling claim, always.
- **Flag, don't guess.** Reasoning not confirmed by canon or a named principal is marked
  (`UNVERIFIED — Emil review`), never asserted.
- **Validate before commit.** All three must pass:
  - `python3 validate-core-order.py core/` — exit 0, zero W4
  - `python3 scripts/validate-claims.py core/claims/` — exit 0. It also prints **warnings**, which
    are candidates and not violations: rule-1 limb candidates, and claims carrying a `test` and no
    `falsifier`. Do not clear a warning by editing a claim without a ruling; the counts at
    `v5.11.0` are 32 upstream and 6 downstream (`DDD-dec-33`).
  - for any decisions, `python3 scripts/validate-claims.py core/decisions/ --decisions`

## Releases

A release is proposed and cut through one file: add `releases/v<major>.<minor>.<patch>.yaml` to
the session's pull request, per `spec/release-format.md`. **Merging that file to the default
branch is what cuts the tag** — CI does it; there is no manual `git tag`, no out-of-band step,
and no privileged local credential in the path. A session expecting a tag on acceptance must
therefore carry the descriptor in its PR (the freight session's `releases/v5.6.0.yaml` is the
exemplar; Wave 3 nearly missed it).

The rules that bite: the filename stem equals `version` and is never reused; `title` carries no
version prefix (the tag message is composed as `<version> — <title>`); `commit` is omitted in
the normal case ("wherever this file lands on the default branch") and set only for a retro-cut;
`basis` is mandatory and every ID must resolve to `core/claims/` or `core/decisions/`;
`summary` is written in the PR, not generated afterwards; descriptors are immutable once cut —
corrections ship as a new version. **New descriptors declare `format: 2` and carry
`ratified_head`** — the commit whose canon the release ratifies; CI refuses the cut unless the
merged head is that commit plus at most the descriptor (the release-head guard, spec §4 rule 7,
`DDD-dec-39`). So the descriptor commit comes last on the branch, and a ruled change after it
means a new descriptor commit naming the new head. Validate with `python3
scripts/validate-releases.py releases/` and `python3 scripts/check-release-head.py
releases/<version>.yaml --at HEAD` before pushing; CI additionally requires all three canon gates
green at the commit under release.

## Cite claim IDs in commit messages

**Every commit that changes canon must cite the claim or term IDs it rests on**, as a `Basis:` line
(e.g. `Basis: DDD-frame-01; term:closure`). This is `DDD-agent-01` applied to this repo's own agents:
long-running agent drift is **escaped decisions caused by basis loss** — context decay removes claim
nodes from the agent's ground, so later edits revert to model priors with no `basedOn` edge. The
remedy is **basis as query, not context residue**: fetch the governing claim from `core/claims/` and
cite it. An edit to `core/` whose commit message names no basis is, by this repo's own ontology, a
candidate escaped decision about the framework itself.

Retired claims are never deleted — they stay in the graph with the correction that killed them
(`core/claims/DDD-measure-08.yaml` is the exemplar). IDs are never reused; renumbering is forbidden.
