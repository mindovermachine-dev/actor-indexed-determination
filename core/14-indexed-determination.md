**Read `00` through `13` first.** This document is deliberately minimal: it states the index that
the rest of canon carries severally, and points at the claims; their files govern, and this prose
is exposition. It establishes three terms and no more — `commitment-level` and `residual-discretion`
(§2), both of them names for content `DDD-frame-02` already states, and `act-address` (§5), the
name for content `DDD-ground-06` states. The tuple itself is a claim,
not a term, and is not minted here. The claims are `DDD-frame-01` (the tuple), `DDD-frame-02` (commitment levels and
residual discretion), `DDD-floor-02` (the relational floor), and the hypothesis set
`DDD-hyp-01` through `DDD-hyp-05` (§4), summarised by `DDD-frame-07`.

**Status: draft, pending ratification** — filed from the Wave 3 session (2026-08-18), drafted
against the Paper A revision foundation (§1.1, §3, §6) with canon at head governing.

## 1. The index

A parameter that never varies is indistinguishable from a constant. The classical allocation
accounts held the arrangement largely fixed while the allocation was analysed, which made the
determiner look like a constant of the analysis. It is a parameter, and not the only one:

> **Unresolved determination is indexed by the tuple ⟨task, ground, acceptance relation,
> tolerance, arrangement, assurance⟩, not by the task alone.** *(`DDD-frame-01`.)*

Canon built the coordinates severally — tolerance and assurance separated in `01`; the
arrangement as the unit of comparison in `00` §3 and `05` §2; ground and the acceptance
predicate in `00` and `03`. The index is those coordinates stated as one relation. Move any
coordinate and the determination problem moves: which distinctions are committed in advance,
which choices remain for the act, which outputs can be checked, whose identity must be trusted,
who answers, and which residual risks stay accepted — or escape.

## 2. Commitment levels and residual discretion

How does an arrangement commit behaviour in advance? *(`DDD-frame-02`.)*

<!-- ddd:embed id=term:commitment-level -->
> A **commitment level** is a level at which an arrangement fixes behaviour in advance:
> **outcome-level** — permitted resolutions fixed directly; **policy-level** — the
> generating procedure fixed; **principal-level** — a determiner selected by qualification
> and case-level resolution delegated. The three compose, and they are levels of
> commitment, not species of actor: the question is never which of three kinds an actor
> is, but at which levels the arrangement has committed.
<!-- /ddd:embed -->

Each level names what an arrangement has already settled before the act begins:

| Level | What is fixed | Instances |
|---|---|---|
| **outcome** | the permitted resolutions themselves | a lookup table, a schema constraint, an invariant admitting one acceptable outcome for a class of cases |
| **policy** | the procedure that generates a resolution | an algorithm, a trained policy, an operating procedure, a controller |
| **principal** | who resolves, selected by qualification, the case delegated | a licensed engineer, a court, a review board |

The levels compose: one deployment can select a principal, bind it to a policy, and enforce
outcome constraints on what results. What the commitments do not reach is left at the act.

<!-- ddd:embed id=term:residual-discretion -->
> **Residual discretion** is the outcome-relevant variation the arrangement's commitments
> leave open at the act, **held at fixed ground**: the alternatives still admissible once
> the standing configuration and the ground at the act are both given. It is not variation
> across ground — a cryptographic hash varies enormously with its input and exercises no
> discretion, because at each input the commitments fix the output exactly. It is not an
> observer's inability to predict a fixed policy, which is a fact about the observer and
> not about the arrangement. And it is not randomness: a deterministic arrangement can
> carry substantial discretion across unfamiliar cases, a randomised one can be tightly
> committed, and a zero-variance arrangement can be consistently wrong.
<!-- /ddd:embed -->

The analytical question is therefore never which of three kinds an actor is; it is at which
levels the arrangement has committed, and what residual discretion is left at the act.

**Held at fixed ground — the qualifier is doing work.** Residual discretion is what the
commitments leave open *at a ground point*, never variation *across* ground points. A
cryptographic hash varies enormously with its input and exercises no discretion at all: at each
input the commitments fix the output exactly, so nothing is left open. Three things are therefore
not residual discretion, and they are commonly mistaken for it — outcome variation across ground,
an observer's inability to predict a fixed policy, and stochasticity. Only the fourth is:
selection the commitments genuinely leave unresolved or delegate.

This is the discharge partition seen from the commitment side. Residual discretion is exactly the
**exercised** value of `DDD-frame-17` — the alternative not predetermined by standing configuration
and ground together, settled at the act by something within the arrangement's control. Where it is
settled by something outside that control it is **drawn**, which is stochasticity, and
stochasticity is not discretion.

## 3. The relational floor

`03` locates the floor in the acceptance predicate, and closure is closure **for an
arrangement** — the two indexings the floor result already carries. Stated over the full index:

> **The judgment floor is relational: irreducibility is a property of the indexed relation, not
> of the task alone.** *(`DDD-floor-02`.)*

The same nominal task is routine for one arrangement and judgment-heavy for another, and better
ground, contracts, checks, and institutions move the boundary without making the task
"intrinsically" simpler in every sense. Each partial form canon already states — the floor as a
property of the predicate (`03`), of the ⟨actor, predicate⟩ pair (`03`, consequence), of the
arrangement's closure bounds (`term:closure`) — is recovered by holding the remaining
coordinates of the relation fixed.

## 4. What the index predicts

The index is not only an accounting; it predicts. Binary human-versus-model predictions are
replaced by graded hypotheses about arrangements — five, filed as the hypothesis set
`DDD-hyp-01` through `DDD-hyp-05` and summarised by `DDD-frame-07` — under one shared falsifier
discipline: each is stated with the preregistration-shaped null of the arrangement study that
would fire it, the conditions compared are arrangements rather than isolated actor labels, and
nominal difficulty and resources are controlled throughout.

- **H1 — operational evaluability** (`DDD-hyp-01`): advantage shifts toward high-throughput
  computational generation as acceptance becomes operationally evaluable, feedback fast and
  dense, ground accessible, checking cheap, and retries affordable.
- **H2 — ground and judgment dependence** (`DDD-hyp-02`): situated arrangements retain
  advantage as ground goes missing, consequences delay, evaluators disagree, criteria drift,
  and tacit knowledge or normative legitimacy is required.
- **H3 — generator/checker composition** (`DDD-hyp-03`): a generator composed with a checker
  or reviewer beats both generator-alone and judgment-alone baselines where generation
  benefits from breadth, much of acceptance closes, and the open residue can be escalated.
- **H4 — accountability completeness** (`DDD-hyp-04`): trust and deployment follow the
  completeness of the accountability relation (`05`), not the executor's kind.
- **H5 — selection versus training** (`DDD-hyp-05`): reliance on selection rises as
  result-level evaluation slows, loses objectivity, drifts, and thins — where the work cannot
  be checked, the worker is.

Two of the five carry a validity qualification restated on their claim files: instruments that
reach open-predicate carriage attach assurance to claimant identity, so they exist only for
identities that outlive their verdict horizons — cross-identity transfer, model version
succession included, is partial and per-capability, and an answer-keyed instrument cannot
evidence such carriage at all (`DDD-cost-13`).

## 5. The act address

The tuple indexes a determination problem, not an act. An act resolving several decisions would
receive several tuples, so the tuple cannot say where an act occurrence sits. The address does:

<!-- ddd:embed id=term:act-address -->
> The **act address** — where an act occurrence sits: its position on declared ground axes and
> its layer path through the composite acts that contain it, read at the act-site. The occupant
> is not part of it, so the same address can be occupied by different actors.
<!-- /ddd:embed -->

The claim is `DDD-ground-06` (projected), filed by `DDD-dec-37`; its file governs. Decisions are
anchored to an address by their applicability predicates (`DDD-ground-01`), over the positions
the address supplies and the ground the act read. The layer path follows from composition: acts
nest as actors nest (`09` §1). The address is declared-space-bound (`DDD-ground-05`): an axis
nobody declared is not part of any address. Leaving the occupant out is what makes it an address
rather than an allocation. Comparisons between occurrences persist between acts and fall outside
this repository's charter (`DDD-dec-09`).

**Status: draft** — filed from the act address landing session (2026-09-28).
